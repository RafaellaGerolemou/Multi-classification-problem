# Multi-classification-problem

- The aim of this notebook is to predict from the text of the document what industry the document is related to.

- This notebook includes:
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes machine learning model
  - Dense deep neural network
  - Convolutional neural network (CNN)
  - Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network
  - Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network
  to deal with the multi-label multi-classification task. 

- The Convolutional Neural Network outperforms the other neural networks with F1 score of 0.94.
